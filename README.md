# Email Agent CLI

An intelligent email management system that uses AI to analyze, classify, and summarize your emails, helping you prioritize and manage your inbox effectively.

## Features

- üìß Automated email analysis and classification
- üè∑Ô∏è Priority-based categorization (Urgent, Important, Normal)
- üìù Smart email summarization with key points extraction
- ‚úÖ Action item identification
- üí° Suggested responses generation
- üìä Beautiful web-based dashboard for email visualization
- üéØ High accuracy confidence scoring

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**
  - Node.js
  - TypeScript
  - Gmail API
  - OpenAI GPT API
  - LangChain

- **Frontend**
  - HTML5
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - Static file generation

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js and npm installed
2. OpenAI API key
3. Google Cloud project with Gmail API enabled

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AveekGoyal/email-agent-cli.git
   cd email-agent-cli
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. Set up Google Cloud OAuth:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Gmail API for your project
   - Go to "Credentials" and create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Download the client configuration file
   - Save it as `credentials.json` in the project root directory

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. On first run:
   - The app will open a browser window for Google OAuth authentication
   - Select your Google account and grant the requested permissions
   - The app will save the authentication token locally

3. View your emails:
   - Open `public/index.html` in your browser
   - Click "Upload Results" to load your analyzed emails
   - Use the time filters to organize emails by time of day
   - View email details, priorities, and AI-generated summaries

## How It Works

1. **Email Fetching**: The application uses Gmail API to fetch your recent emails
2. **AI Analysis**: Each email is analyzed using OpenAI's GPT model to:
   - Determine priority
   - Extract key points
   - Identify action items
   - Generate suggested responses
3. **Results Generation**: 
   - Analysis results are saved to `public/analysis-results.json`
   - A static dashboard (`public/index.html`) displays the results
   - No server is required - just open the HTML file in your browser

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

### Source Code (`src/`)

#### Core Components
- `index.ts`: Entry point of the application. Handles the main execution flow and CLI interface.

#### Agents
- `agents/emailAgent.ts`: Core email processing agent that orchestrates the analysis workflow:
  - Manages the AI model configuration
  - Coordinates between different analysis tools
  - Handles confidence thresholds and result validation
  - Implements retry and improvement logic for low-confidence results

#### Services
- `services/gmail.ts`: Gmail API integration service:
  - Handles Gmail authentication
  - Fetches emails and their metadata
  - Manages API scopes and permissions
  - Provides methods for email operations

#### Tools
- `tools/emailTools.ts`: Collection of AI-powered email analysis tools:
  - Email classification tool (priority determination)
  - Email summarization tool (key points extraction)
  - Analysis evaluation tool (quality checking)
  - Analysis improvement tool (refinement of results)

#### Types and Interfaces
- `types/index.ts`: TypeScript type definitions:
  - Email data structures
  - Classification results
  - Summary formats
  - API response types

### Public Assets (`public/`)
- `index.html`: Static dashboard for visualizing email analysis:
  - Priority-based email cards
  - Filtering and sorting capabilities
  - Interactive UI elements
- `analysis-results.json`: Generated file containing processed email data

### Configuration
- `.env`: Environment configuration file:
  - API keys
  - Authentication credentials
  - Service configurations

### Documentation
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `LICENSE`: MIT license file

## File Relationships

1. The process starts in `index.ts`, which initializes the email agent
2. `emailAgent.ts` uses the Gmail service to fetch emails and coordinates the analysis
3. `gmail.ts` handles all Gmail API interactions
4. `emailTools.ts` provides the AI-powered analysis capabilities
5. Results are saved to `analysis-results.json`
6. The dashboard in `index.html` reads and displays the results

## Dashboard Features

- **Priority Filtering**: Filter emails by Urgent, Important, or Normal priority
- **Read/Unread Status**: Quickly identify unread emails
- **Direct Gmail Links**: Open any email directly in Gmail
- **Action Items**: View suggested actions for each email
- **Smart Summaries**: Get AI-generated summaries of email content
- **Confidence Scores**: See the AI's confidence in its analysis

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Error Handling

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check your API keys and credentials
2. Ensure all required scopes are enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Verify your `.env` file contains all required variables
4. Check the console for error messages
5. Ensure you have sufficient API credits (OpenAI)

## Security

- Never commit your `.env` file or `credentials.json` to version control
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files
- OAuth tokens are stored locally and are not shared
- Email data is processed locally on your machine

## Development

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The following files are important for frontend development:

- `public/index.html`: Main dashboard interface
- `public/styles.css`: Tailwind CSS imports
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind configuration
- `postcss.config.js`: PostCSS configuration

To modify styles:
1. Use Tailwind utility classes directly in HTML
2. For custom styles, extend the theme in `tailwind.config.js`
3. The dashboard uses Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler via CDN for development
